# Forest Fire Animation
Animation to simulate the dynamic process of forest fire algorithm. In this project, I separated the task for the simulation into two parts.
- Part 1 : Class ```forest``` that stores attributes such as matrix to represent the forest and the dimension of the forest.
- Part 2 : Example for the visual simulation of forest fire algorithm using object ```forest```.
